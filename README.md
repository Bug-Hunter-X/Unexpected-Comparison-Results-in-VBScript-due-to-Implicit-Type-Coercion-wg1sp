This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript stemming from its implicit type coercion during comparisons. The script includes a function that compares two numbers, but due to potential type mismatches or implicit conversions, the comparison might not always yield the expected result.  The solution provides a robust method to handle such comparisons, ensuring accurate results even with various data types.
